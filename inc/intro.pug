    li Prompt updates on their diagnosis and treatment plan with additional updates at discharge

  p We understand the central role of the GP in patient health. We also appreciate the challenges of forging any new professional relationship. So, we embrace collaborative treatment approaches, and ensure that our communication is clear, relevant and timely.
