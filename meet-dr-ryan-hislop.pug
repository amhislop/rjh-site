        p Dr Ryan has always had a passion for helping people, and became a chiropractor because he wanted to help his patients live their best possible life.

        p He says, "Being a chiropractor allows me to help people through the entire care process, often from seeing someone present in acute pain and disability, to seeing them get back to enjoying the activities and hobbies they love, and most satisfying of allâ€”maintaining that high quality of life. It is very satisfying to see these results and see how this impacts their life and those around them."

        p He chose to attend Macquarie University for his chiropractic studies.

        p With a thorough and careful approach, Dr Ryan takes time to discover the exact cause of your symptoms before proceeding with treatment. "Symptoms are often misleading and only tell part of the story. It takes some time and careful examination to see precisely what has malfunctioned in the body for the problem to arise."

        p Apart from being a chiropractor, Dr Ryan is also a husband to his beautiful wife, Jess. "In our free time, we both enjoy spending days on her parent's farm at Yeoval, dirt bike riding, and spending time with friends. We also have a great kelpie named Belle, who ensures we get lots of exercise!

        p Both my wife and I are passionately involved in youth work and youth ministry. Each Friday night we lead a group of 10-15 teenagers at Mudgee Baptist Church. It is a lot of fun and very worthwhile. Once a year, we also lead 30-40 teenagers on a dirtbike camp in the southern highlands. I am also a member of the Rural Fire Service."
